WARNING: No preset parameters were found for the device that Open MPI
detected:

  Local host:            cn004
  Device name:           mlx5_0
  Device vendor ID:      0x119f
  Device vendor part ID: 4123

Default device parameters will be used, which may result in lower
performance.  You can edit any of the files specified by the
btl_openib_device_param_files MCA parameter to set values for your
device.

NOTE: You can turn off this warning by setting the MCA parameter
      btl_openib_warn_no_device_params_found to 0.
